# InstacartPython

This project was given by the Data Analytics course from Career Foundry

Project overview:

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

Data Set:

Throughout this Achievement, we used a number of open-source data sets from Instacart. We also receive a customer data set (created and included for the purpose of this project).

[customers.csv](https://github.com/Alexal09/InstacartPython/files/9794795/customers.csv)
[products.csv](https://github.com/Alexal09/InstacartPython/files/9794800/products.csv)
[departments.csv](https://github.com/Alexal09/InstacartPython/files/9794802/departments.csv)
the order.csv is too big for this medium.

What you will find in the attached folders:

01 Project Management: the project brief

03 Scripts: the Jupyter note books used to accomplish the project brief goals and class lessons

04 Analysis: in the visualization folder you will find all the charts create to analyse the data
